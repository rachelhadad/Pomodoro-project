#Pomodoro-Timer

A timer customized to the Pomodoro Technique which encourages you to break your workday into 25-minute phases with 5-minute breaks in between.

After clicking start, the timer counts down from 25 minutes. Once the 25 minutes are up, the timer automatically switches to a "Break" screen and counts down from 5 minutes. After 8 work sessions, the break session is 10 minutes long.
